# Managing public (or private) projects using GitHub

We use a common set of labels across projects in GitHub. It is
possible to precisely control this set of labels using
the [settings GitHub app][github-app-settings] (needs to be enabled
for your org). Use the [`settings.yml`](../.github/settings.yml) from
this repository as a starting point.

## Labels

We use labels to classify tasks by priority, from P0 to P4:

* **P0 (blocker)** Do not do anything else, this is a blocker.
* **P1 (critical)** Must have.
* **P2 (major)** Should have.
* **P3 (minor)** Could have.
* **P4 (trivial)** Someday/maybe. Consider closing as "wontfix".

Labels are also useful to classify issues by type or by component. Use
colours to distinguish whether a label designates a type, a component
or something else.

## Project leads

Each project must have a project lead (maintainer). By convention, the
PL is whoever appears at the top of [`CODEOWNERS`][github-codeowners]
file, e.g.:

```
* @mboes
```

This has the effect that @mboes will automatically be tagged as
a reviewer for all incoming PR's, unless later lines in the same file
override that.

## Milestones

We gate tickets with milestones. Milestones always have an associated
due date.

## Releases

Every public release must include a `CHANGELOG.md` file, in the format
of [keepachangelog]. New entries to the changelog are integral parts
of bug fix and feature PR's.

Each release has an associated tag of the form `v$VERSION`, GPG-signed
by the project lead (use `git tag -s`).

## Documentation

Every document has a *document owner*. The owner is usually specified
in the document itself. By default, the project lead is the owner for
all documentation in the project.

We do not use [wikis][github-wiki] for documentation. The reasons for
this are well explained [elsewhere][yesod-documentation-thoughts].
When using [GitHub pages][github-pages], we *do not* use a separate
`gh-pages` branch to hold documentation. The reason is that this
breaks the ability to update documentation atomically with the
associated code changes. We typically keep the documentation in
a `docs/` folder. This can readily be deployed to a public site
using [GitHub pages][github-pages-conf]
or [Read the Docs][readthedocs].
